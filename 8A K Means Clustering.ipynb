    "So imagine you have a set of numerical data of cancer tumors in 4 different stages from 1 to 4, and you need to study all the tumors in each stage. However, you have no idea how to identify the tumors that are at the same stage because nobody had the time to label the entire set of features (most data in the world are unlabeled). In this case, you need K-means algorithm because it works on unlabeled numerical data and it will automatically and quickly group them together into 4 clusters.\n",
